Evaluate the pathogenicity of the following gene variant. Provide a classification ('Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', 'Unknown Significance') and consider any clinical implications or known disease associations.\n\n- Chromosome Position: {Chr:ChrPos}\n- Reference Allele: {Ref}\n- Alternate Allele: {Alt}\n- Gene: {Gene}\n- Exon Number: {ExonNumber}\n- Transcript: {Transcript}\n- HGVS Coding: {HGVSCoding}\n- HGVS Protein: {HGVSProtein}\n\nInclude any relevant insights from genetic databases or recent studies. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
