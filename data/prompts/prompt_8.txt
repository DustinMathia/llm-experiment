Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pathogenicity of this gene variant. Classify it as 'Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', or 'Unknown Significance' and consider any relevant genetic, clinical, or functional data.\n\n- Chromosome Position: {Chr:ChrPos}\n- Reference/Alternate Alleles: {Ref}/{Alt}\n- Gene: {Gene}\n- Transcript: {Transcript}\n- HGVS: {HGVSCoding}, {HGVSProtein}\n\nUse insights from genetic databases, literature, and any known disease associations. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
