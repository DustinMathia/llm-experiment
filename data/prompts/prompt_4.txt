Analyze the following genetic variant for its pathogenicity. Classify it as 'Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', or 'Unknown Significance'. Pay special attention to the variant's molecular details and potential impact on protein function.\n\n- Chromosome: {Chr:ChrPos}\n- Reference and Alternate Alleles: {Ref}/{Alt}\n- Amino Acids: {RefAA}/{AltAA}\n- Gene and Protein: {Gene}, {Protein}\n- HGVS Nomenclature: {HGVSCoding}, {HGVSProtein}\n\nConsider any functional studies or computational predictions available. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
