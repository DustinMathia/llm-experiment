Provide an evidence-based assessment of the pathogenicity for the following gene variant. Classify it as 'Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', or 'Unknown Significance'.\n\n- Position: {Chr:ChrPos}\n- Alleles: {Ref} > {Alt}\n- Gene: {Gene}\n- Transcript: {Transcript}\n- HGVS: {HGVSCoding}, {HGVSProtein}\n\nConsider any known associations with genetic disorders or phenotypic effects. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
