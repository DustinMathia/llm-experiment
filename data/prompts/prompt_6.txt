Assess the pathogenicity of this gene variant using known genetic databases and literature. Classify it as 'Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', or 'Unknown Significance'.\n\n- Chromosome and Position: {Chr:ChrPos}\n- Alleles: {Ref}/{Alt}\n- Gene: {Gene}\n- Exon: {ExonNumber}\n- HGVS: {HGVSCoding}, {HGVSProtein}\n\nConsider any known pathogenicity data or clinical significance from databases like ClinVar or HGMD. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
