Please provide a detailed assessment of the pathogenicity of the following gene variant. Classify it as 'Benign', 'Likely Benign', 'Likely Pathogenic', 'Pathogenic', or 'Unknown Significance'. Consider the variant's molecular characteristics, potential functional impact, and any known clinical associations. Use evidence from genetic databases, literature, and computational predictions to support your classification.\nChromosome Position (Chr:ChrPos): {Chr:ChrPos}\nReference Allele (Ref): {Ref}\nAlternate Allele (Alt): {Alt}\nGene: {Gene}\nVariant Type: {Type}\nExon Number: {ExonNumber}\nTranscript: {Transcript}\nHGVS Coding (cDNA): {HGVSCoding}\nHGVS Protein: {HGVSProtein}\nCoverage: {Coverage}\nConsider any conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity and provide a rationale for your classification based on the most reliable evidence available. Answer with only one type. Do not include your reasong in the response, the response must only be the classifcation.
