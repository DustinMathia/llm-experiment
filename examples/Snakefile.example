# --- Rules Section ---

# Rule 1: The default target rule ("all")
# When you run snakemake, this rule is executed first.
# It defines the final list of files we want to produce.
rule all:
    input:
        # The expand function dynamically creates file paths:
        # outputs/A.processed.txt
        # outputs/B.processed.txt
        expand("outputs/{sample}.processed.txt", sample=SAMPLES)

# Rule 2: The processing step
# This rule processes a single input file to create a single output file.
rule process_data:
    # Wildcard {sample} will be filled with "A", "B", and "C" by Snakemake.
    input:
        "inputs/{sample}.txt"
    output:
        "outputs/{sample}.processed.txt"
    # The shell command uses the defined input and output placeholders
    shell:
        "cat {input} | sort -n > {output}"
        # (Assuming 'sort' is your processing command here)
